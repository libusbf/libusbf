libusbf
-------

libusbf is a C library simplifying implementation of USB functions in
userspace by encapsulating FunctionFS API. This is a device-side
equivalent of what on host-side is libusb. It shouldn't be confused with
libusbg library designed for USB gadget composition.

For now this is proof-of-concept simple library with unstable API,
but it allows to use most of FunctionFS functionality. It automates
USB descriptors generation process and binds synchronous comunication.

The goal is to create full featured simple in use library with synchronous
and asynchronous communication API, fully covering FunctionFS functionality.

libusbf requires Linux kernel version 3.16 or later.
